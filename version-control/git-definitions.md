# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control allows us to view the entire history of revisions to one or more files, and **merge** revisions made by different people.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a distinct version of a file that may be used by multiple engineers at the same time to collaborate on different features for the same project.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a save point in the file that you've added to git to track. A good commit should have a commit message so other team members, or even yourself at a later date, can understand at a glance what changes were made with a give commit. A good commit message should be specific and concise.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when two branches have changed the same part of the same file, and then those branches are merged together.
