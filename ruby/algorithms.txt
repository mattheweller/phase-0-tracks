Create new function:

1. Inform the robot to create a new function "Use elevator".

Define the function:

2. Use elevator will take an string as an input from me and will require "Identify Object"

3. Because the string input contains numbers, we'll have to scan the string to see if the input contains only numbers, or letters and numbers, and handle them differently.

4. Thoroughly define a translation of my commands so that the robot understands that when my input contains:
  i.    a number + "st" or "th" to look for the button with that associated number.
  ii.   "Basement Level" + a number, look for the button with "B" + that associated number.
  iii.  "Lobby", or "Lower-lobby" look for the button with "L", or "LL" associated with it.
  iv.   "Mezzanine", look for the button with "M" associated with it.
  v.    "Ground", look for the button with "G" associated with it.
        a. However, if there are no "B" + number, and there is an "L" button in the button array, "G" + a number refers to "Garage" + level defined by a number.

Calling the function:

5. If the robot, and I are in the elevator when I give the robot the input for Use elevator, the robot will use Identify Object to identify the button panel.

Executing the function:

6. Once the panel is identified, and the path to the panel is clear, the robot should approach the panel, so that the robot can reach and press the buttons from a safe distance.

7. Robot should press the button that corresponds the given input. Once this is complete, exit the Use elevator function and be prepared for the next request.

Alternative exiting the function to avoid getting stuck in a loop:

8. If input is not identified on the button panel array, I'll say "Ohferchrissake! Get out of the way and I'll do it." Robot should then step a safe distance away from the button panel array.

Create new function:

1. Inform the robot to create a new function "Do the Laundry".

Define the function:

2. Do the Laundry will require "Hamper" "Laundry Detergent" "Laundry money" "House keys" "Laundry Room" "Washing Machines" "Dryer" "Clothes Handling" "Color Awareness"

Calling the function:

3. If the robot is Home, and I tell the robot, either locally, or remotely, "Do the laundry"

Executing the function:

4.  Robot will locate the Hamper, pick up and secure the hamper for carrying.
5.  Robot will locate the Laundry Detergent, pick up and secure the Laundry Detergent for carrying.
6.  Robot will locate the Laundry money, pick up and place the Laundry money in Robot's robo-pocket...
7.  Robot will locate the House Keys, pick up and place the Laundry money in Robot's robo-pocket...
8.  Robot will exit Home and once outside lock the door with the House Keys, returning House Keys to the robo-pocket.
9.  Robot will travel to and enter the Laundry Room.
10. Robot will approach the Washing Machines and determine if they are currently in use.
11. If the Washing Machines are not in use, Robot will use Color Awareness and sort the laundry between bright colors, dark colors, and garments with special Clothes Handling instructions into "Loads".
12. Robot will determine that no load is too large for any one Washing Machine.
13. Robot will load one load into each available Washing Machine.
14. Robot will identify the money slots on the Washing Machines, and place the appropriate amount of money needed into the slots.
15. Robot will place the appropriate amount of Laundry Detergent into each Washing Machine that has one of our loads loaded into it.
16. Robot will set the settings of the Washing Machine, according to the load's Clothes Handling instructions, and start the washing Machine.
17. Robot will wait in the Laundry room, in a safe, and out of the way space until the Washing Machine has finished.
18. Robot will use Dryer to repeat steps 10, 13, 14, 16, and 17.
19. Robot will repeat Washing Machines and Dryer process until all clothes are washed and dried.
20. robot will check that clothes are dry at the end of each completed Dryer cycle, and repeat steps 16, 17 if clothes are not dry.
21. Robot will use Cloths Handling to fold the clothes, and place into Hamper.
22. Robot will travel from Laundry Room to Home, once inside, lock the door, return House Keys, Laundry Money, Laundry Detergent, and Hamper.

Alternative exiting the function to avoid getting stuck in a loop:

23. If any of these steps fail, I'll say "Ohferchrissake! Get out of the way and I'll do it." Robot should then step a safe distance away from the Laundry.
