print a request for a word (or optionally a phrase, but this will require " " parsing),
Gets the input and store as the secret word
print a request for another user to guess the word, one letter at a time.
Each time the player makes a guess, output something like "_ _ _ _ _ _ _" to represent the secret word's length
The guessing player receives continual feedback on the current state of the word. So if the secret word is "unicorn", the output would become "_ _ _ c _ _ _" after the user enters a guess of "c".
Guesses are limited to the length of the number of letters in the word
Repeated guesses do not count against the user.

The user should get a congratulatory message if they win, and a taunting message if they lose.
