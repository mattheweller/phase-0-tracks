    <p>Cats would almost certainly hunt squirrels given the chance.
    <hr />
    <p>Cat's are known for their <em>hunting prowess</em> as well as their need for exercise. They use scratching posts to keep their claws sharp, and this is why if they don't have a scratching post, they'll <strong>make do with the couch!</strong>
    </p>

    <p>And here's some more things about cats:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Cats are similar, but different, from a complex sentence:
        <ul>
          <li>Cats have claws at the end of their paws</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Complex sentences have a pause at the end of their clause</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>A cat's teeth are hella sharp when they're kittens</li>
    </ol>
